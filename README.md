## About me
I build **web apps, tools, and libraries** with **React + TypeScript/JavaScript**.  
I care about things that make products *actually good*: performance, accessibility, SEO, maintainable architecture and shipping.

I'm currently deep into **AI-assisted development** - not as a substitute for thinking, but as a power tool used with judgment. I know where AI accelerates work, where it's bad, and where it confidently makes stuff up. I still love coding without it too! 💜

## What I do
- **Frontend-first fullstack**: strong React ecosystem focus, Node.js on the backend when needed.  
- **Accessibility nerd**: WCAG, ARIA, audits, systematic fixes etc.  
- **Process optimizer**: automate the annoying bits, reduce friction, keep teams in flow.  
- **Debugging detective**: the weirdest problems are the most fun ones.

## Now
- Building and evolving a production app: **iguanaflow.com**  
  (developed with Lovable + Cursor, continuously expanding AI features).
- Learning **React Native**.
- Following and practicing **AI Safety** (member of **AI Safety Poland**).
