Senior full-stack engineer who lives mostly on the frontend. I build web apps, tools, and libraries with **React + TypeScript/JavaScript** and I actually enjoy the boring parts like accessibility, SEO and debugging the weirdest edge cases.

Right now I’m deep into **AI-assisted development** — not as a replacement for thinking, but as a power tool used with a seatbelt on. I know where AI helps a lot, where it helps a bit, and where it confidently lies. Still love coding “the old way” too. Balance > hype.

---

## What I do
- **Frontend-first fullstack**: React ecosystem is my home, Node.js my reliable backyard.
- **Accessibility nerd**: WCAG, ARIA, audits, fixes, building things that work for humans, not just demos.
- **Process optimizer**: I like removing friction, automating the annoying bits, and shipping faster without shipping bugs.
- **Debugging detective**: I *love* the strange problems. The stranger the stack trace, the happier I am.

---

## Currently
- Building and evolving a production app: **iguanaflow.com** (developed with Lovable + Cursor, growing AI features continuously).
- Learning **React Native** (because leaving the browser occasionally is healthy).
- Following and practicing **AI Safety** (member of *AI Safety Poland*).

## Tech stack (battle-tested)
**Frontend:** React, TypeScript, JavaScript, Next.js (SSR/SSG), Redux, Zustand, HTML5, RWD, SEO, WCAG, webpack, Vite  
**Styling:** CSS/SCSS, styled-components, Tailwind, Material UI, React Aria  
**Backend:** Node.js + Express, REST API, SQL, GraphQL, GROQ  
**Testing:** Cypress, Playwright  
**Infra:** Docker, CI/CD  
**AI tools:** OpenAI, Copilot, Cursor, Lovable

## Tiny human facts
- Too much coffee, lots of flow states.
- Metal/rock (and basically anything with energy) in my headphones while coding.
- Tech is a means to an end. I use frameworks and libraries gladly, but sometimes “plain” is the cleanest solution.

If you’re building something ambitious and want it fast, accessible, and solid — feel free to ping me.
